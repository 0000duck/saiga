Asset Loading + Rendering
- AssetLoader that returns an object that can be rendered
- Vertex colored meshes (without textures)
- textured meshes
- a mix of both
- different file formats (use assimp)
- load appropriate shaders

- uncolored assets
- Colored assets
- Textured assets
- animated assets



General
- better shader names
- remove 'renderer interface' (to window)
- multiple window support?
- borderless fullscreen
- init opengl and context always at beginning
- don't derive from window


new glfw_window(...) //init opengl context + window
new program
window.setProgram(...)

window.startmainloop
